## Installation

BMates is available as a package on NPM for use:

```

## Create Component

Please import the BMates component.

```tsx
import { BMates } from '@bmates/studio';
```

Set the appropriate props for the BMates component.

```tsx
<BMates
  data={data}
  style={style}
  trackEl={({ track, muted, toggleMute }) => {
    return (
      <div className="track">
        <div>{track.category}</div>
        <ToggleMute muted={muted} onClick={toggleMute} />
      </div>
    );
  }}
/>
```

Other frameworks besides React are currently in preparation.

## Framework

`@bmates/studio` is a library built for React based on `@bmates/editor`.
If you want to use it in other frameworks, please utilize `@bmates/editor`.

```shell
# NPM
npm install @bmates/editor
```

We will support other frameworks soon.
