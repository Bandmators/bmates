You can track the situation by receiving events for specific situations.

The `Event` module provides a way to manage events in your application. It includes methods for subscribing to, unsubscribing from, and triggering events.

## Event Types

The following `EventType` are supported:

- `click`
- `mousemove`
- `mousedown`
- `mouseup`
- `mouseleave`
- `mouseover`
- `mouseout`
- `dragstart`
- `draging`
- `dragend`
- `wave-dragstart`
- `wave-draging`
- `wave-dragend`
- `pause`
- and custom event types

## EventData

`EventData` is the parameter type of the callback function that is called with event issuance.
It can include various properties depending on the type of event.
Here are some common properties that may be included in `EventData`:

- **target**: `Node`

  - The element that triggered the event.

- **originalEvent**: `MouseEvent`

  - Information about the original mouse event that occurred, including details such as click, movement, etc.

- **bubble**: `boolean`

  - Indicates whether the event bubbles.
    If `true`, the event propagates to parent elements.
  - default is true.

- **position**: `{ x: number, y: number }`

  - The coordinates of the event, useful for mouse-related events.

- **data**: `any`

  - Additional data related to the event, which can be useful in custom events.

### EventData Structure

```typescript
interface EventData {
  target: Node;
  point?: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  originalEvent?: MouseEvent;
  bubble?: boolean;
  data?: any;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

This structure allows event handlers to access relevant information about the event, enabling more dynamic and responsive event handling in your application.

```ts
type EventHandler = (event: EventData) => void;
```

## Methods

### on (eventType, handler)

Subscribes a handler function to the specified event type.

| Name      | Type           | Description                                      |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| eventType | `EventType`    | The type of event to listen for.                 |
| handler   | `EventHandler` | The function to be called when the event occurs. |

```ts
const handleClick: EventHandler = (event: EventData) => {
  console.log('Click event triggered:', event);
};

//
editor.on('custom-click', handleClick);
```

### off (eventType, handler)

Unsubscribes a handler function from the specified event type.

| Name      | Type           | Description                                         |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| eventType | `EventType`    | The type of event to stop listening for.            |
| handler   | `EventHandler` | The function to be removed from the event listener. |

```ts
editor.off('custom-click', handleClick);
```

### call (eventType, eventData)

Triggers the specified event type, calling all subscribed handlers with the provided event data.

| Name      | Type        | Description                                  |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| eventType | `EventType` | The type of event to trigger.                |
| eventData | `EventData` | The data to be passed to the event handlers. |

```ts
editor.call('custom-click', {
  target: null,
  originalEvent: new MouseEvent('click'),
  bubble: true,
  position: { x: 100, y: 200 },
  data: 'custom-click',
});
```
